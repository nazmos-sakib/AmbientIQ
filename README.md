AmbientIQ : A Sophisticated Smart Room Ecosystem for Ultimate Comfort and Efficiency. Our prototype addresses the critical role of indoor climate control in maintaining the well-being of individuals, particularly those vulnerable to health issues stemming from insufficient humidity and tempera- ture levels. At its core, our system features a DHT22 sensor, a micro-controller [Pinecone](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineCone#PineCone_BL602_EVB_information_and_schematics), relay switches, and wireless control options. The humidity sensor accurately monitors and controls humidity levels, while the temperature sensor finds the current temperature. In order to capture various signals from different sensors, the microcontroller[Pinecone](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineCone#PineCone_BL602_EVB_information_and_schematics), processes data and adjusts the heating device and humidifier accord- ing to user preferences. Android application will be used as a user interaction point with the system, where users can set convenient temperature and humidity levels and monitor the temperature and humidity range. An Android app that is connected to a microcontroller via WiFi provides realtime information about current temperature and humidity levels. The app also enables users to make decisions about balancing settings for their comfort and health

Key Features:
=====

+ ‚úèÔ∏è [Manual Control:]() Connected devices like Light, Heater, Humidifigher and so one can be controlled manually.

+ üåü [Automation:]() User can set temperature and humidity parameter through the app. If the Temperature is below, the heater will autometically turned on and if the heat in the room reach target temparature the the heater will auto matically turned off. And the same goes for humidity and humidifigher.
  
+ üåü [User-Friendly:]() The app's clean and user-friendly design ensures a seamless experience, making it suitable for users of all ages.

=======
[PineCone](https://pine64.com/product/pinecone-bl602-evaluation-board/) BL602 Evaluation Board(EVB). It is based on the BL602 SoC and has a 32-bit RISC-V microprocessor, 276kB RAM and 128kB ROM.It is an open- source IoT development board with builtin USB to Serial, PCB antenna, and USB-C connection. It supports Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. Also it offers 2MB Flash for pro- totyping IoT projects and features onboard LEDs, en- abling communication with the web application for real- time data visualization and notification delivery.
